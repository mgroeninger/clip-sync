| Plan | Covers |

## Open work

### Gap-selection parked debt (do not fold into thin v1)

From [archive/TEMP-gap-selection-sequencing-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/TEMP-gap-selection-sequencing-plan.md) §4.
Survive archival of that meta doc. Not required for `--only-gaps` / `--skip-gaps`.

| Item | Direction |
|------|-----------|
| `--gaps-from` manifest (v2) | Reuse a prior gap list + embedded `ScanRecipe`; mismatch → error on index entries. Prerequisites (ranges, recipe) shipped. Sketch: [archive/TEMP-gap-selection-deferred.md](docs/dev/archive/TEMP-gap-selection-deferred.md) §2. `--scan-window` is **refused** (identity): [gap-vocabulary.md](docs/dev/gap-vocabulary.md) § Gap numbering. |
| `limit_fill_to_mapped_region` on scan report | Wrong home; recipe plan explicitly out of scope — separate cleanup if ever moved |
| Absolute B occupancy via `BlockLevel.silent` (not aggregate RMS) | Optional; `silent` is now retained for equivalence (F2). Fillability still uses aggregate `rms_db` vs abs floor — switch if multichannel false-unfillable shows up. |

### Fingerprint provenance follow-ups

Leftovers from [archive/TEMP-fingerprint-provenance-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/TEMP-fingerprint-provenance-plan.md)
(Tracks A + B shipped 2026-07-31). All three were **deliberately deferred**, each with a stated
trigger — none is a known defect. Shipped behaviour: [gap-fingerprint.md](docs/dev/gap-fingerprint.md)
§ *Source identity & the corpus library* and § *`measurement`*.

| Item | Direction |
|------|-----------|
| I1-class bin-divergence warn in `equivalence-calibration` (optional; was out of that plan's DoD) | Emit lives: flag gaps where `a_gap_total_blocks × measurement.bin_ms` disagrees with the geometry span. The check is documented and the fields are on both verdicts, so this is only automating a query a human can already run. Trigger: a second bin-width divergence (I1 was found by reading source, which is what made the fields Derived) |
| Row-level "no provenance" flag on `GapRow` | Deferred: `check.rs`'s health Warn plus the census's `(absent)` bucket already make an unanswerable corpus say so, and the pattern to mirror is `registration_from_legacy_lag`. Trigger: a report that needs to **filter** rows on it — nothing does today |
| `bit_depth` string → `BitDepth` parser | Deferred: the forward pin (`bit_depth_tokens_are_pinned`) is what protects corpora already on disk; a parser is dead code until a consumer reads the token, and none does. `bit_depth` is stored-for-later by design |


### Equivalence margin band

**Not a gate change yet — the gate stays on by default.** Thresholds provenance and the band *report*
shipped 2026-08-01 (`GapEquivalenceThresholds`, `equivalence-calibration --band`); what is open is the
experiment that would justify making the band a production rule. Semantics:
[gap-fingerprint.md](docs/dev/gap-fingerprint.md) § *The margin band*.

| Item | Direction |
|------|-----------|
| **Run the banded gaps with the gate off** (the gating step) | The band names 16 of 528 dropped gaps across 7 of 39 pairs (±1.0 dB dropout, ±1 donor block) — 3.0 % of drops. The dumps cannot say whether keeping them is right: a dropped gap has `outcome: skip` and no counterfactual. Re-run just those with `--no-skip-equivalent-gaps --only-gaps <tokens>` and read what the repair path does. If it declines most on their own merits the band is nearly free; if it patches most, listen before believing it is safe. **Blocked on a re-dump**: the 2026-07-31 39-pair corpus predates `thresholds`, so `--band` refuses it rather than assuming 35.0/0.5 |
| Sizing note — the donor boundary dominates | Within-band populations on the 39-pair corpus: dropout boundary ±1 dB = 23 gaps (2.9 %), ±2 dB = 51; donor boundary at one block = 116 (14.5 %), because donor windows on the flip-sensitive set are 5–18 blocks so one block is 6–20 points of the fraction. An earlier read put the *rescued* set at 76; that over-counted by banding the donor axis alone — a `shared_silence` gap whose donor relaxes into occupancy still lands in `ambient_quiet` (a drop) unless A is also a dropout. Corrected figure is 16, pinned by `donor_relaxation_alone_does_not_rescue_a_non_dropout` |
| Band as a production rule | Only after the experiment. Cost if adopted at these widths: ~350 vs 274 gaps entering the expensive path per 39 pairs (+28 %), against +193 % for disabling the gate outright. Do **not** pursue the disable-by-default variant without also revisiting the `min_gap_ms = 500` pairing, which exists because the gate cleans up after the sensitive scan (`config.rs` § `default_min_gap_ms`) |

### Dual-fit confidence axis

**Fingerprint / analysis only** — not a production dual-fit scope change. Do not wire
into `try_dual_fit` / rescue gating (seam ledger A5/D8: uniqueness stays diagnostic until a
labeled false positive). From [archive/TEMP-fill-placement-axis-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/TEMP-fill-placement-axis-plan.md)
Phase B residue (the `gate_pass` / end-search correlation). Axis semantics:
[gap-fingerprint.md](docs/dev/gap-fingerprint.md).

| Item | Direction |
|------|-----------|
| **Dual-fit `gate_pass` is a production mirror, not a discriminator — add a fingerprint confidence axis** | `gate_pass = min(pre_seam_r, post_seam_r) ≥ max(0.35, 0.12)` passes **263/263** on the 17-pair corpus. That is faithful, not broken: it reproduces the production gate exactly, and production's threshold sits far below the observed distribution (p05 of `smin` = 0.892) because `smin` is a ±600 ms argmax with no uniqueness term. Its value is provenance — "what did production decide" — so it should **not** be tightened. What's missing is a *separate fingerprint read* on whether the seam lag was unambiguous (analyzer / corpus roll-up strata — not a repair gate). The validators that discriminate are already emitted but ungated: `pre/post_seam_z` (p05 3.14, p25 4.91, median 7.86) and `pre/post_seam_prom` (p25 0.123). **Direction:** leave `gate_pass` alone (the goldens and corpus history read it); add derived fingerprint field `dualfit_confident` from min-z + min-prominence. **Do not** consolidate end-search length into dual-fit: on the throat cohort (n=65, where `span == gap`) the two disagree genuinely, not by dilution — `corr(fill−span, bridge−gap)` = +0.06, and tightening the amplitude floor drives it to −0.10; stratifying by min z reaches r = +0.68 only at n=8 / p=0.053, one of ~25 strata swept. In the z ≥ 6 cohort, 8 of 19 gaps show an end excursion of exactly 0 ms while dual-fit trims 4–28 ms. |


### Repair R6 follow-ups

From [archive/repair-write-path-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/repair-write-path-plan.md) post-ship gaps.

| Item | Direction |
|------|-----------|
| `--dry-run` / `--write` | Explicit CLI flags; today write mode is implied by `--wav` / `--mux` or TOML `dry_run = false` |
| Scratch-buffer regression test | Dedicated unit test for patch PCM path |
| Streaming / chunked WAV encode | Large multi-gap fills without holding full PCM |
| Adaptive gap-signature context (low priority) | Widen `gap_signature_context_secs` per-gap only when the score at the nominal map is below floor, instead of decoding wide B context for every gap. From [energy-signature-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/energy-signature-plan.md) Phase 4; low value since mode-coupled `nominal_bias` already handles drift at the 3 s default |
| `fill_repeat_correlations` channel alignment | **Done 2026-07-31:** multichannel repeat uses `seam_score_channel_indices` (same ~20 dB set as seam/residual), drops mono from the max, unscoreable → `0.0`; band twin kept in lockstep. |
| Dual-fit oracle: unpin pre-shoulder lag from 0 (optional hardening) | `validate_dual_fit_oracle.rs` (gated `validation-tests`, needs ffmpeg + fetched corpus) only steps the **post**-shoulder (`step_ms`); the pre-shoulder is always sourced from B at lag 0 by construction (`dual_fit_oracle.rs`). The 2026-07-03/05 production bug (dual-fit's re-validation gate wrongly applying the single-rigid-lag crossfade branch, fixed via `SpliceSeamContext::single_lag_alignment`) is now covered end-to-end by a synthetic unit test (`dual_fit_result_passes_the_production_revalidation_gate`, `domain/dual_fit.rs`), so this isn't blocking. Direction if picked up: add an optional `pre_step_ms` field to `DualFitOracleCase` (default `0.0`, mirroring `step_ms`) that shifts the pre-gap portion the same way the post-gap portion is shifted, plus a manifest case with both nonzero — proving the real-codec path too, not just the synthetic gate. Not yet implemented or run (needs ffmpeg + real media, which wasn't fetched here per the licensed-media partition) |

### Patch verdict integrity — `Patched` does not mean spliced

**Latent defect, detector already shipped.** `splice_into_a` (`patch_audio/region.rs:2287`) returns
`()` and has three early returns; the `Patched` verdict is decided *upstream* of it
(`region.rs:189–221`, from `region_results`) and the summary is built from that same pre-splice list
(`patch_audio/mod.rs:454`). Nothing tells the summary the splice bailed.

| Bail condition | Line | Reported today |
|---|---|---|
| destination out of range | `:2298` | `tracing::warn!` |
| inverted / empty (`start >= end`) | `:2308` | **nothing at all** |
| fill shorter than the gap | `:2314` | `tracing::warn!` |

Effect: the gap table says repaired, the audio is unchanged, and in the middle case there is no
signal whatsoever. Worst for `--gap-listen`, where `_a_patched.wav` comes back byte-identical to
`_a_surround.wav` — you hear an unrepaired gap and conclude *the repair sounds bad*, inverting the
finding on exactly the gaps a margin-band experiment selects.

**Detection exists; the verdict is still wrong.** `--gap-listen` digests the A window before and
after the splice and warns on a match (`gap_listen/mod.rs:444`) — a symptom check on one diagnostic
path, not a fix. Direction: have `splice_into_a` report applied/not-applied and reflect that in the
gap status. Reachable by inspection only — **no observed real-media occurrence**, and the firing
path has no end-to-end test (forcing a genuine no-op splice needs fault injection that does not
exist yet). Uncovered by, but not introduced by, the gap-listen work.

### Residual gate follow-ups

From [archive/residual-gate-findings.md](docs/dev/archive/residual-gate-findings.md) and
[archive/residual-gate-wiring-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/residual-gate-wiring-plan.md). Test inventory:
[`residual_gate_catalog/`](crates/clip-sync-repair/tests/residual_gate_catalog/).

| Item | Priority | Direction |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **M3** — floor walk vs B haystack OOB | med | `walk_reference_frames` is A-energy only; B OOB → NaN at measure time today. Tighten walk only if field media hits bad geometry |
| **G1** — residual on Pearson-only skips | gap | Veto skips done (`ResidualHeadroomExceeded` + `GapPatchOutcome.residual`). Pearson/structure skips still lack residual unless we measure on last grid candidate when `measure_residual` |
| **L6** — coarse outward walk step | low | `step_frames = window` in `measure_fit_residual_verdict`; changes floors → recalibrate if touched |
| **M4** — MP3 calibration | defer | Manifest rows marked M4; gate is codec-agnostic |
| **FD-1** — fractional-delay cancellation | defer | Sub-sample lag + B resample; re-run floor calibration — see findings § FD-1 |
| **`finale_floor_nan_probe`** | optional test | Unit repro: why Grieg finale floor is NaN (M3-adjacent); catalog backlog |
| **`c1b_acoustic_echo_pipeline_veto`** | optional test | Pipeline `ResidualHeadroomExceeded` under `production_fit` on non-F4 echo fixture — optional C1b |
| **`p2_search_winner_bounds`** | optional test | Bound headroom on search winner vs truth placement — needs design |

**Explicitly not planned:** `veto_rescue` as default (G5: synthetic-only); F4 pipeline veto (M6).

### Defer / opportunistic

| Item | Direction |
|------|-----------|
| [Offset-mapped end placement](#offset-mapped-end-placement) | After start clip, place B end window at `A_end + Δ` when B has a long leader — see [archive/anchored-end-extraction-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/anchored-end-extraction-plan.md) follow-ups |
| [Skip overlapping end fingerprint](#skip-overlapping-end-fingerprint) | Omit end clip when `T_anchor − L` overlaps start window |
| [Weighted drift in repair warning](#weighted-drift-in-repair-warning) | Down-rank end clip in instability synthesis when end confidence is low |
| [Memory / PCM cloning](#memory-use-and-pcm-cloning-on-long-clips) | `Cow` / in-place prep when painful; parallel A/B decode when needed |
| [Committed test fixtures](#committed-test-fixtures) | Optional committed MP3; committed verify deferred — see [tests/corpus/README.md](tests/corpus/README.md) |
| [Verification cost knob](#verification-cost-knob) | `validation.max_verification_secs` — only on demonstrated friction |
| [Test tier follow-ups](docs/dev/test-tier-remainder.md) | `clip-sync` ignore cleanup (~1 h), optional `pr-repair-extended` / SP on PR, Phase 2b binary split — see [test-tier-remainder.md](docs/dev/test-tier-remainder.md) |

#### Memory use and PCM cloning on long clips

15-minute default clips; full PCM in memory per extracted window; no streaming fingerprint API yet. **Decided (2026-06-11):** future streaming should reuse `scan_*_buckets` callbacks; `MediaSession: Send` allows one session per thread when parallel decode lands — see [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) § Media session semantics and [archive/media-session-redesign-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/media-session-redesign-plan.md).

**Refs:** `application/align_videos.rs`, `domain/pcm_preparation.rs`

#### Committed test fixtures

Tier B = 3× 30 s WAV pairs; ffmpeg for encoded formats. Hold-out verify on committed tier deferred — generated-only coverage documented in [tests/corpus/README.md](tests/corpus/README.md).

**Refs:** `tests/corpus/`, `Cargo.toml` features

#### Verification cost knob

Optional `validation.max_verification_secs` — deferred in [archive/verification-hardening-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/verification-hardening-plan.md). Implement only if verify decode cost becomes painful in practice.

**Refs:** [corpus-validation.md](docs/dev/corpus-validation.md) § Hold-out verification cost

#### Offset-mapped end placement

Symmetric `SharedTimeline` places end windows at the same absolute times on A and B; when B has a long leader before shared content, offset-mapped end (`[T_a−L, T_a]` on A, shifted by Δ on B) would align fingerprints to the same story region.

**Refs:** [archive/anchored-end-extraction-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/anchored-end-extraction-plan.md)

#### Skip overlapping end fingerprint

When `T_anchor − clip_length` overlaps the start window (short shared span), skip end fingerprinting to avoid comparing redundant audio.

**Refs:** `domain/policies.rs`, `application/align_videos.rs`

#### Weighted drift in repair warning

Repair instability warning treats end − start drift equally; down-rank or de-emphasize end when end confidence is low or tail decode was unreliable.

**Refs:** `clip-sync-repair/src/infrastructure/cli/output.rs`

## Explicitly out of scope (initial version)

From [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) — not backlog unless scope changes:

- Video frame / visual sync
- Batch processing (> two files)
- Writing aligned output files from the **analyzer** (report offset only)
- Patched repair output is **`clip-sync-repair`** only — [archive/repair-write-path-plan.md](docs/dev/archive/repair-write-path-plan.md)
- Network or streaming sources
